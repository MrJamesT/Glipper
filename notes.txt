1. can maybe auto detect if you finished playing a game and then remind you to cut clips?

2. should be able to:
	- estimate file size
	- fit file to discord upload limit
	- delete file after cutting
	- add file to compilation cut
	- mark the start and end of file for cutting
	- show file sizes and folder sizes
	- show file duration
	- everything should be controllable with keyboard shortcuts so you can be fast

3. settings should allow:
	- when to start each clip (for example default 10s before the end - cause that's where most action happens)
	- when to end each clip (if clipped later)

4. nice to haves:
	- choose between table and tile view (with preview)
	- electron auto updater
